##Extracting Malawi Covid-19 Tweets#

###Objectives#
The aim of this task is to extract covid tweets from Malawi’s main cities and get insight from the data.

###Justification#
Twitter data will be analysed to recognize People’s views on covid issues. 

###Methodology#
The tweets were extracted by specifying a particular hashtag and location (Malawian cities, within a certain radius) and then saved to a csv file. The sentiment analysis part was based on Polarity and Subjectivity. 
Polarity is split to Positive, neutral and negative which will help us to draw assumptions or conclusions on the nature of the tweet (For example if there are more Positive covid tweets then there might be fewer covid cases or a lot of recoveries). 
Subjectivity is split to whether a tweet is a fact or an opinion which will help us know if People know covid facts or just assumptions(i.e. covid facts might mean adherence to health advice on covid). The analysis will be displayed in python visuals (Pie-charts).
